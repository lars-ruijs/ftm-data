# Data visualization for Follow the Money

Follow the Money is a Dutch website dedicated to investigative journalism. Follow the Money asked us to visualize data about political ads on Google and Facebook. These visualizations support the articles the journalists write on this subject and can provide new insights to readers.

More information about Follow the Money can be found at the official website [FTM.nl (Dutch)](https://www.ftm.nl/over-ftm).

The data we use for this project is collected and bundled by data journalists from Follow the Money. They use the datasets ["Google Transparency Report on Political ads](https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/region/EU)" and the ["Facebook Ads Library"](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=NL&sort_data[direction]=desc&sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped).
